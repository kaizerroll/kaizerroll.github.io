title: Learning 7 Languages - Motivation
---

I've been considering what I want to focus on at *The Recurse Center* and I've found my brain has been pulled in a lot of different directions. I was interested in FRP, so I built a small paint program in RxJS, I was interested in React, so I build a basic comments section in React, then ported it to React Native (at least partially). 

Ultimately I felt a certain *dissatisfaction* though. I was using a number of tools, but most projects ultimately involved the glue-ing together of a number of libraries to achieve functionality - simple on the surface, but with all the complexity hidden below (and written by someone else).

A thing I've always been fascinated by though is how the *fundamentals* of a language help you think differently, teach you paradigms that could be implemented in another languge but are core to the design in another. Towards this end, I'm interested going for breadth over depth and doing a tour of language. To do this I'm going to be reading [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/product-reviews/193435659X/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending), an overview of a number of different languages from different paradigms. We'll see about the 7 weeks. But if there's time left, [making my own language](http://createyourproglang.com/) is what's next!
